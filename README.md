# ts-discord-bittrivia
A Discord bot that asks random questions.... randomly

## Info
With every message sent in a discord channel, there is a small chance of the bot asking a random question. The respondent can then answer correctly/wrongly. Questions are grabbed
from an external open-source API. Trains me to make basic http requests and parse raw data into usable and functional code.
